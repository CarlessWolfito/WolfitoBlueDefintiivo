#so our selfbot itself worked.
#lets have a little fun defining a command

    print("hello command was used.") #prints that the command was used.
    await ctx.send("hello command was used") #since its a async function you gotta use await to call functions i guess.
    message1 = await ctx.send("i like to do sus stuff") #message1 is the message being sent
    await message1.delete()  
# so now we are done with our event but our selfbot does nothing.
